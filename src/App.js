                            Typically, she offers supportive or emotionally focused therapy in 30-minute follow-up visits. However, occasionally Dr. Gaveras may believe that additional therapy is also needed and ask that you bring another therapist into your care team to provide the best outcome.


                            In addition to general, child, and adolescent psychology, Dr. Gaveras is also board-certified in addiction medicine and trained in the Eating Disorders, Compulsions and Addictions Service (EDCAS) program at the William Alanson White Institute.
